Grid.Scaffold(list)

Editor.Scaffold(object).Render();

- Grid.Scaffold can't handle struct and/or records!!

- EntityTable can handle multiple fields like "_" and "__" with hidden headers.

- Varför kan inte IBladeRenderer hantera icke Renedered scaffolds?

- SelectEditors not working with string string

- FileEditor should be able to handle multiple paths -> string[]

- Show toaster looks weird.
